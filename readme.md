# Plug 2

## Hype Machine API Codes

Our Hype Machine API codes are embedded in the source. If those codes get out it will very much jeopardize our relationship with Hype Machine. Please be careful with this source. Please do not publish it openly or attempt to create you own forks of Plug.

## Dev Setup

```sh
# Get the code
git clone git@github.com:wulkano/plug.git
cd plug

# Install CocoaPods (make sure you have CocoaPods installed on you machine https://cocoapods.org/)
pod install
```

You should be set up. Open Plug.xcworkspace to get started.

## Contributing
